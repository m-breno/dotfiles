# Breno's dotfiles

My Arch Linux dotfiles

Different window-managers, compositors and programs have their own repositories.
They are all here for easy installation of everything. *- one clone to download them all*

If you just want to clone my [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) dotfiles for example, you can clone just [dotfiles-hyprland](https://github.com/m-breno/dotfiles-hyprland).
> **NOTE:** Always read the repository's README.md to search for any dependencies
